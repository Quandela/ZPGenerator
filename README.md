# ZPGenerator

Coming soon!

The ZPGenerator package provides an object-oriented interface and robust numerical backend for simulating quantum 
optical experiments using sources of pulsed quantum light that evolve in time following the laws of quantum physics. 
It implements a method that exploits zero-photon measurements to efficiently simulate photon detection 
of light produced by time-evolving emitters [[S. C. Wein, arXiv:2307.16591 (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16591)]. 
These types of quantum-dynamic simulations demand a detailed understanding of the underlying physics and, using standard 
methods, often require a lot of time to code from scratch and are also computationally expensive to run. ZPGenerator 
aims to make these physics simulations accessible and fast without the hefty knowledge overhead, allowing for quick 
prototyping of photonic experiments.
